Prest is primarily focused on hypermedia because it's very natural for the REST and allows as cross-platform UIs as it gets. It's not a panacea - [when to use hypermedia](https://htmx.org/essays/when-to-use-hypermedia/), but it's good enough for a lot of cases. I think even more than this essay suggests.

Extending client side with maud, htmx and hyperscript. Twind also sounds good. 

Cargo manifest is the same as in the host example except for the package name, but in our rust code we'll explore more UI things.
