I want a simple stack based on web technologies because they're supported on almost all devices and widely known among the developers, while also being able to expand the app's features in any direction. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and it's ecosystem provide a nice balance of development experience, performance, safety and platform support. It nicely fits server needs and thanks to the rich [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) support it can also handle UI faster than JavaScript. So I've figured out [how it all comes together](https://edezhic.medium.com/reliable-software-engineering-with-rust-5bb4553b5d54), [composed prest](https://prest.blog/inside) and [working on it](https://prest.blog/roadmap).

There are already frameworks like Tauri and Dioxus, but I think that [PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) capabilities enable a simpler approach. Inspiration came from [this simple PoC](https://github.com/richardanaya/wasm-service) - combination of a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) based on Rust compiled into [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) library. In a similar way we can cross-compile server rendering code for the SW and get a restful client almost for free. Also, there are plenty of [Web APIs](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/) available through [wasm bindings](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), [WASI](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/WASI-intro.md) ecosystem to simplify devops and fascilitate serverless, [WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-io2023/) for cross-platform AI, complex UIs and games, and many other web-related tech being developed for all kinds of use cases.
