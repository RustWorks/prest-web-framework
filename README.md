**P**rogressive **REST**ful framework designed to simplify cross-platform app development. You can navigate high-level docs in the [blog](https://prest.blog) which is also [built with prest](https://prest.blog/blog) in less than 100 lines of code! If you want the simplest examples check out [hello](https://prest.blog/hello) and [hello PWA](https://prest.blog/hello-pwa).

Initial inspiration came from [this simple PoC](https://github.com/richardanaya/wasm-service) - combination of a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) based on Rust compiled into [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) library. This combo is based on web standards which are widely supported and well known among engineers. Just write some HTML and get a cross-platform installable UI. Htmx can easily power most UIs with way less effort than other front-end stacks, while [rust provides reliable solutions](https://edezhic.medium.com/reliable-software-engineering-with-rust-5bb4553b5d54) for all kinds of back-end needs. And thanks to the wasm-powered service worker they fit together really well.

There are other rust frameworks like [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), and plenty of frameworks in other languages like React Native and Flutter, but I think that [PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) capabilities enable a simpler approach, especially with Rust on the server side. Not everything is ideal - Rust definitely isn't the simplest of programming languages. Such performance and reliability come at the cost of learning how to use them properly. So the first priority of prest is to provide a simple default setup that allows devs to start their projects in minutes. The second is to provide plenty of interactive examples that deal with auth, databases, logs, deployments and other common tasks.

### Getting started
It's not published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/prest) yet because it depends on the latest unreleased [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) 0.7 changes. 

You can clone the repo and import it locally or run the examples with `cargo run -p NAME`... `hello`, `hello-pwa`, ...

To run it on your machine you'll need the latest stable [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/). Most examples are supported on [replit](https://replit.com/) so you can [fork it there](https://replit.com/@eDezhic/prest) and run in the cloud. It includes [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) and I suggest to use it in local development as well. Some examples require additional setup which can be found at prest.blog/example-name and in their folders' readmes.

Under the hood it's based on [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) for ergonomic routing on both server and client. It's also based on [http](https://docs.rs/http/latest/http/) and [tower](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/) for compatability with many other crates. It includes a slightly modified forks of [Maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz/) to easily include HTML snippets inside Rust code and [Rust Embed](https://github.com/pyrossh/rust-embed) to easily bundle PWA and other assets with the compiled binary. [Tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/) is the only supported async runtime at the moment.

There are plenty of [Web APIs](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/) available through [wasm bindings](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), [WASI](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/WASI-intro.md) ecosystem to simplify devops and fascilitate serverless, [WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-io2023/) for cross-platform AI, complex UIs and games, and many other web-related tech being developed for all kinds of use cases.

Interactions with Web APIs from Rust code are powered by [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/), [js-sys](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/contributing/js-sys/index.html) and [web-sys](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/contributing/web-sys/index.html). Also, if you want to include custom TypeScript code in the project they can generate TS declarations of the exported Rust types, and prest also includes [SWC](https://swc.rs/) to transpile and bundle that code. It also includes [grass](https://docs.rs/grass/latest/grass/) - speedy SASS -> CSS compiler for your UI needs. Most likely it will include more common web tooling in the future.

### Deployment
Temporarily deployed to replit by compiling into the `musl` target and including binary into the repo due to [this issue](https://ask.replit.com/t/deployment-time-outs/73694). To rebuild the binary run `cargo build -p blog --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release` and move `target/.../serve` it into the `_temp_deployment` folder.
