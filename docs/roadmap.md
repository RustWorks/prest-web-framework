This is a hobby project, there are no solid long-term plans and api is unstable. However, there are things I'll likely work on next:

- fill in examples' readmes and clarify prios in the roadmap
- embed blog styles.css without build.rs?
- update default logo+favicon and how they are used with PWAOptions
- extract todo ui into a separate crate to refine Storybook-like workflow

### Examples
+ with-[seaql](https://www.sea-ql.org/) toolkit stuff
+ with-[oxc](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc)
+ with-[hermit](https://github.com/dylibso/hermit)?

### Publish
It's not on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/prest) yet because it depends on the latest unpublished [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) changes. Awaiting it's 0.7 release to publish the first alpha version.
