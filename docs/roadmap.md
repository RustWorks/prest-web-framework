This is a hobby project, there are no solid long-term plans and api is unstable. However, [the overall idea](https://prest.blog/motivation) seems quite promising to me so there are things I'll likely build next:

- readmes for examples and include them into the blog
- clarify prios in the roadmap
- update default logo+favicon and how they are used with PWAOptions

### Examples
+ with-[seaql](https://www.sea-ql.org/) toolkit stuff
+ with-[oxc](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc)
+ with-[hermit](https://github.com/dylibso/hermit)?

### Publish
It's not on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/prest) yet because it depends on the latest unpublished [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) changes. Awaiting it's 0.7 release to publish the first alpha version.
