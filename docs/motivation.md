Long story short - prest is about making app development simple again. It's based on web technologies because they're supported on almost all devices and widely known among the developers. It's built in Rust because it provides a nice balance of development experience, performance, safety and platform support. It nicely fits all kinds of server needs, and thanks to the rich [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) support it can also handle UI faster than JavaScript. Just write some HTML and get a cross-platform UI. Add a couple of lines to make it installable, enable offline work and automatic background updates. Solve any tasks like auth, database integrations, loggers, serverless deployments and many others with ease thanks to interactive examples and [rich ecosystem](https://edezhic.medium.com/reliable-software-engineering-with-rust-5bb4553b5d54).

There are already frameworks like Tauri and Dioxus, but I think that [PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) capabilities enable a simpler approach. Inspiration came from [this simple PoC](https://github.com/richardanaya/wasm-service) - combination of a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) based on Rust compiled into [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) library. I want to highlight HTMX and [Hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/) because they allow solving almost any UI problem without JavaScript, JSON and other common front-end tech. This way we can cross-compile some server rendering code for the Service Worker and get a restful client almost for free. Also, there are plenty of [Web APIs](https://fugu-tracker.web.app/) available through [wasm bindings](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen), [WASI](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/docs/WASI-intro.md) ecosystem to simplify devops and fascilitate serverless, [WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-io2023/) for cross-platform AI, complex UIs and games, and many other web-related tech being developed for all kinds of use cases.

Not everything is ideal - Rust requires significant onboarding. Such performance and reliability come at the cost of learning how to use them properly. So one of the main goals of prest is to provide a simple default setup that allows devs to start their projects in minutes.
